## :pencil: Main Description

This test consists of developing an API with Ruby on Rails to send registration information to emails using Mailchimp as the Email Service Provider.

The use of Dockerfile / Docker-compose was implemented to be able to run the app locally, as well as the implementation of Redis and Sidekiq for process handling.

This application connects to an API developed in Ruby on Rails, which can be found at the following link:[Email Subscriber API](https://github.com/jucora/email-api)

## How to install the App

1. Please clone the repository by running the next comand in your machine:

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/jucora/email-app.git</code></pre>

2. Get into the folder of the project by running the next command:

<pre><code>cd email-app</code></pre>

3. Next, run the next command to install all project dependencies:

   For Yarn: <pre><code>yarn install</code></pre>
   For npm: <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>

4. Start your local server by running the next command:

   For Yarn: <pre><code>yarn start -p 3001</code></pre>
   For npm: <pre><code>npm start -p 3001</code></pre>

Note: you can select another port if you wish. Just keep in mind that it has to be a different port from the API port.
